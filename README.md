# project-enumerables
This project is to implement my own version of some ruby enumerable methods.

# Project Features
This project is a customized implementation of some ruby enumerable methods. The following methods were implemented: 
- my_each- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #each.
- my_each_with_index- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #each_with_index.
- my_select- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #select.
- my_all?- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #all?.
- my_any?- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #any?.
- my_none?- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #none?.
- my_count?- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #count.
- my_map- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #map.
- my_inject- mimicking ruby's enumerable method #inject.
- I tested my_inject by creating a method e.g. multiply_els().
  This method takes an array [2, 4, 5] argument, calls my_inject on it to multiply the array elements together to produce a result => 40.
- I tested my_map by creating a proc and called my_map on it to produce a    result depending on the body of the proc. 
- I included a file that contains testing of all the methods implemented     in the module. You can run tests.rb file for clarity. The methods worked   perfectly well like its ruby's equivalent and this is the purpose of       this project.
